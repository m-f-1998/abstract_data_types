# Abstract Data Types (ADT)

### Created by Matthew Frankland (November 2017)

## Problem Specification

An abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. Implement a variety of ADTs in Java.
