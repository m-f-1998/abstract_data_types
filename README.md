# Abstract Data Types - ADT

Def: An abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.

Note - This is a working repository which I may update with the same abstract data type in multiple languages over time. I currently have implementations for Java.
